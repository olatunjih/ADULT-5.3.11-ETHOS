## Overview

ADULT 5.3.11-ETHOS is a distributed AI framework that processes requests through a pipeline of ingestion, routing, inference, learning, and metrics computation. It emphasizes:
- **Security**: Zero-trust compliance, secure deletion, and data anonymization.
- **Resilience**: Fault tolerance via chaos engineering and dynamic node scaling.
- **Adaptivity**: Self-tuning, adaptive thresholding, and federated learning.
- **Transparency**: Detailed audit trails and user-friendly explanations.

The system is designed for enterprise-grade applications, particularly in industries like finance and healthcare, where compliance and ethical considerations are paramount.

## System Architecture

The system is organized into modular components, each handling specific tasks:

1. **Service Orchestrator**: Coordinates the request pipeline (ingestion → routing → inference → learning → metrics).
2. **Provenance Tracker**: Tracks data origin and transformations for integrity.
3. **Zero-Trust Compliance**: Enforces access control and regulatory compliance.
4. **Secure Deletion**: Ensures data is erased per NIST standards.
5. **Federated Learning**: Aggregates model updates across nodes securely.
6. **Chaos Engine**: Simulates node failures to test resilience.
7. **Simulation Engine**: Manages system dynamics and node health.
8. **Memory**: Handles short-term and long-term memory with pruning and snapshots.
9. **Tokenizer**: Converts inputs into task signatures for routing.
10. **Validation Model**: Ensures output quality and consistency.
11. **Transparency Report**: Generates audit trails and explanations.
12. **Self Modal Engine**: Processes multimodal inputs (text, image, audio, video).
13. **Knowledge Base & RAG**: Manages and queries factual knowledge.
14. **Self-Tuning & Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamically adjusts system parameters.
15. **Governance UI**: Provides interfaces for metrics and transparency.

### Data Flow
1. **Ingestion**: Validates and tracks incoming requests.
2. **Routing**: Assigns tasks to experts based on task signatures.
3. **Inference**: Processes tasks across distributed nodes.
4. **Learning**: Updates models using adaptive learning strategies.
5. **Metrics**: Computes performance metrics (e.g., bias, hallucination scores).
6. **Transparency**: Generates detailed reports for accountability.
